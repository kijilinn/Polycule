# Polycule Daemons

Project in process; code generated by AI but dumbed down for baby-coder (me). 
I'm a new coder, started learning Python in mid-January 2026 using boot.dev and an AI chatbot 
(referenced in documentation as "Beebs", "Byte Bandit", or "Min-Jun". The eventual plan for 
this project is to have daemons running for each character in my cast, tracking their daily 
routines in real-time, modifying mood, loneliness and a few other factors based on events, 
randomly rolling events occasionally and then outputting to a group chat client, DMs and 
direct emergency pings to my phone when they decide something is important enough for my 
attention. 

Needless to say, I have no idea what I'm doing. Please be kind with comments.
